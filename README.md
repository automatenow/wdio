## About this project
This WebdriverIO project was created by [Marco A. Cruz](http://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-a-cruz) and it uses the [Lambdatest e-commerce playground](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/).

Please refer to the [video tutorial playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZMWkkQEwOPkg0nLg2Jd3xQ2yX86zK0js&si=Aciy2lDaXtI1AJax) on the Lambdatest YouTube channel for more details.

## Prerequisites
The tests are designed to run on Lambdatest, so you will need to create a free account [here](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register) if you don't already have one.

You will all need to create environment variables with your Lambadatest username and access key. Visit [this page](https://github.com/LambdaTest/webdriverio-selenium-sample?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites-for--webdriverio) for more information.

## What is WebdriverIO?
WebDriverIO (or _wdio_ for short) is an open-source end-to-end testing framework for web applications. Built on the WebDriver protocol and Node.js. WebDriverIO allows developers to automate browser interactions and perform comprehensive testing on web applications. It provides a convenient and flexible API for writing test scripts in Javascript programming languages, and its modular architecture allows integration with different testing tools and services. 

WebDriverIO supports multiple browsers, frameworks, and testing services, enabling the creation of robust and maintainable test suites. It is commonly used for functional testing, regression testing, and browser compatibility testing to ensure the reliability and quality of web applications across different environments.
